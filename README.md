SDGPSR is a personal development project to search the sky for all 32 GPS Satellites, track them, demodulate their nav data, determine their positions, current time, and finally form the navigation solution. 
This is not intended for actual use in any application, it was written for my own understanding of how GPS Receivers actually work, and what issues/limitations they deal with. 

### Major items that still need to be implemented:

* Satellite Errors (clock, relativistic, etc)
* Sagnac effect
* Code cleanup from original development
* Makefile for shared library
* Writeup of the process and results
